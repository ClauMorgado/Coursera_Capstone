    "In this project the aim will be to find the optimal location for a coffee shop in Lisbon, Portugal. Since I live in Lisbon, the decision to use this example for my project was very objective since I already know the city very well as well as were to find the data needed for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lisbon is not a highly populated city, in the 2019 census the number of inhabitants was approximately 500.000; the city is divided in 24 neighbourhoods occupying an area of about 80 square kilometers. In recent years Lisbon has been visited by an increasing number of tourists, about 5 million guests/year making it a city where new businesses are opening on a daily basis so choosing a place to start a new one can be difficult because there is a lot of competition and renting a place in or near the city center can be quite expensive.\n",
    "Lisbon has a large and rich coffee culture so opening a new coffee shop will always be a good idea because for locals goind out for coffee in the morning, lunch and evening is somewhat of a routine; for tourists it is usually the chosen place to take a break for sightseeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective for this project will be to find a location still close to the city center where the surroundings are not already crowded with other coffee shops."
